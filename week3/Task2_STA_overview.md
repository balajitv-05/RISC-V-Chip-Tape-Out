## 1. Introduction

* Overview of the course/session.
* Outline of the topics to be covered.

## 2. First things first - Introduction to timing graph

* Understanding the **timing graph** model of a digital circuit.
* Defining **paths** (data paths, clock paths) within the circuit.

---

## 3. Clk-to-q delay, library setup, hold time and jitter

* **Clk-to-q Delay ($\text{t}_{\text{CQ}}$):** The fundamental delay from the clock edge to the output of a flip-flop.
* **Library Setup:** Introduction to standard cell library timing models (e.g., NLDM, CCS).
* **Setup Time ($\text{t}_{\text{SETUP}}$):** The minimum time data must be stable *before* the clock edge.
* **Hold Time ($\text{t}_{\text{HOLD}}$):** The minimum time data must be stable *after* the clock edge.
* **Jitter:** The variation in the clock signal period or phase.

## 4. Textual timing reports and hold analysis

* Interpreting and generating reports from Static Timing Analysis (STA) tools.
* Focus on **Hold Time Analysis**â€”checking for the shortest paths and ensuring $\text{t}_{\text{HOLD}}$ constraints are met.
* Understanding Slack (Positive and Negative).

## 5. On-chip variation (OCV)

* Introduction to **On-Chip Variation (OCV)**: How manufacturing and environmental factors cause timing variations across the chip.
* Impact of OCV on clock and data paths.
* Modeling variation sources (process, voltage, temperature).

---

## 6. OCV timing and pessimism removal

* Performing timing analysis with OCV models.
* Addressing **Pessimism** introduced by traditional OCV analysis (e.g., common path pessimism).
* Techniques for **Pessimism Removal** (e.g., $\text{CRPR}$ - Common Reference Path Pessimism Removal).

## 7. Summary 
The image outlines a detailed instructional progression on Digital Timing Analysis, likely within the context of Static Timing Analysis (STA) for integrated circuits. The course or material starts with fundamental concepts like the timing graph and core timing parameters (Clk-to-Q, Setup/Hold time, Jitter). It then moves into practical application, covering how to interpret timing reports and perform necessary checks, particularly for hold time. The latter part of the curriculum addresses advanced, real-world challenges in VLSI timing, specifically the impact of On-Chip Variation (OCV), and explores methods to accurately model this variation while minimizing unnecessary design conservatism (pessimism removal). In essence, it covers the entire spectrum of timing closure, from basic definitions to advanced variation-aware analysis.
