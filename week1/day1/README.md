## üìò Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
1. **Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog**  
   - Basics of iverilog simulator  
   - Running Verilog files with iverilog  

2. **Introduction to iverilog design test bench**  
   - Understanding Verilog testbenches 
        Testbenches do not have the primary inputs and primary outputs, instead it has test vectors.
   - Writing and simulating a simple testbench

   - Running simulation with iverilog  
   - Analyzing waveforms with gtkwave  
   - Deep dive into waveform analysis  
   - Debugging RTL design

## ‚öôÔ∏è Introduction to Yosys and Logic Synthesis
4. **Introduction to yosys**  
   - Basics of yosys synthesis tool  
   - Simple synthesis flow  

5. **Introduction to logic synthesis Part**  
   - Running synthesis using yosys  
   - Understanding yosys commands  
   - Gate-level netlist generation  
   - Comparing RTL vs synthesized netlist

## üß© Labs using Yosys and Sky130 PDKs
6. **Yosys 1 good mux**  
   - Implementing a good mux design in Verilog  
   - Synthesizing with yosys  
    - Gate-level netlist visualization  
    - Analyzing design with Sky130 cells
